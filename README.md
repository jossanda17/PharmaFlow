This project aims to address challenges in Indonesian pharmacies, where over 80% still rely on manual record-keeping. The focus is on developing an advanced pharmacy stock management application that adheres to health regulations, utilizes machine learning for sales prediction, and integrates seamlessly with mobile devices. The machine learning component involves preparing and training a diverse dataset, deploying the model to the cloud (Google Cloud Platform). For mobile development, Kotlin and Android Studio will be used to create an intuitive app, and cloud computing involves setting up a Firebase database, creating APIs, and deploying the backend on GCP App Engine. The ultimate goal is to revolutionize pharmacy operations, enhance healthcare services, and promote data-driven decision-making.
